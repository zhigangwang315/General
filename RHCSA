1. cracking the room passwd

Chapter 9.8 practice: resetting a lost root password

change the root passwd to root1234
-  Press e
- rd.break
- mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
- chroot /sysroot
- passwd root
- touch /.autorelabel
- exit twice


2. configure the primary network interface with hostname example.com (alias rhcsa1). IP address 192.168.4.251/24, gateway 192.168.4.2, and namae server 192.168.4.200. You may use different IP assignment

chapter 10 lab
Examing network configuration
-  ip addr
- ip -s link show eth0
- ip route
- ping 172..25.1.254 ( verify that the router is accessible)
- tracepath classroom.example.com
- ss -lt


- nmcli con show (“System eth0”)
- nmcli dev status
- nmcli dev show eth0

cmcli connection
nmcli connection delete “System eth0” (no network)

- nmcli con add con-name “system eth0” ifname eth0 type ethernet autoconnect yes ip4 191.168.4.251/24 gw4 192.168.4.2

- nmcli con mod “System eth0” ipv4.dns 192.168.4.200
- nmlci con show
- nmcli con show –active
-  nmcli con up “System eth0”

- ip a (to test)

Test the connectivity:
- ip addr show eth0   - veryfy IP
-  ip route  (verify default gateway)
- ping 192.168.4.2 (ping the DNS address
- cat //etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-System_eth0
- host hostname (classroom.example.com)
and 
- host <ip_addr> should return the hostname

3. Set the default boot target to multiuser

- systemctl get-default
- sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
- sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target


4. set Selinux to enforcing mode

- get tab-tab to get a list of command starting with “get”
- getenforce
- cat //etc/selinux/config
 - edit the config file and change it to “Enforcing”
getand reboot

5. create the following user,group and group memberships:
A Group named sysgrp
A user andrew who belongs to sysgrp as a secondary group
A user susan also belongs to sysgrp as a secondary group
o A user sarah who does not have access to an interactive
system and who not a member of sysgrp
Andrew, susan and sarah password=”postroll”

-  groupadd sysgrp
- useradd andrew
- useradd susan
-  usermod -aG sysgrp andrew
- usermod -aG sysgrp susan
- useradd -s //sbin/nologin sarah
- passwd andrew (susan, sarah)

Verification
id andrew
id susan
su – sarah


6 create a collaborative directory /redhat/sysgrp with the following characteristics:
	–> Group owneship of /redhat/sysgrpis sysgrp
	–> The directory should be readbale,writable, and accessable to members of 	sysgrp,
	but not to any other user.
	(It is understood that root has access to all files and directories on the 	system.
	–> Files created in /redhat/sysgrp automatically have group ownership set to 	the sysgrp group

-  mkdir -p redhatsysgrp
-groupadd sysgrp
- chgrp sysgrp //redhat/sysgrp |or
- chown :sysgrp //redhat/sysgrp
- chmod 2770 //redhat/sysgrp   //Set the setgid bit, and read/write/execute for user and group on directory:
  Add the setgid bit on directory:
  chmod g+s directory

verification:
ls -ld //redhat/sysgrp

7 Enable IP forwarding on your machine

- vim /etc/sysctl.conf
   add net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
- Enable it using:
   sysctl -p


8 copy the file /etc/fstab to /var/tmp
configure the permission of /var/tmp/fstab so that
the file /var/tmp/fstab is owned by the root user, belongs to the group root
should not be executable by anyone.
The user andrew is able to read & write /var/tmp/fstab
The user susan can neighter write nor read /var/tmp/fstab
All other users (current or future) have the ability to read /var/tmp/fstab.

- cp /etc/fstab //var/tmp/fstab
- chown root:root /var/tmp/fstab
- setfacl -m u:andrew:rw- /var/tmp/fstab
- setfacl -m u:suan:--- /var/tmp/fstab

to verify:

- getfacl /var/tmp/fstab
- su - andrew and try to write to /var/tmp/fstab e.g. echo "#test" >> /var/tmp/fstab
- su - susan and try to write to the file and it should fail

9 Add the user talusan with userid 2985

- useradd -u 1985 talusan
to verify
- id talusan

10. find the file which owned by user julice and copy the file into /root/findresults directory.

- mkdir /root/findresults
- find / -user julice -exec cp -rfp {} /root/findresults/ \;

11. create an archive file /root/local.tgz for /usr/local. it should be compressed by gzip.

- tar -cvzf /root/local.tgz /usr/local

12. Search the string sarah in the /etc/passwd file and save the output in /root/lines

- grep sarah /etc/passwd > /root/lines
- cat /root/lines
 
13. create a new 100MB Physical partition mounted under /gluster
(Note because partition sizes are seldom exactly what is specified when they are created, 
any thing within the range of 70MB to 120MB is acceptable)

-fdisk /dev/vdb ----- > Create the Partition of 100M
  partx /dev/vdb
- mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb2 ------> Make a filesystem on it
- mkdir -p /gluster -----> Create Directory to mount on it
- blkid ------> Get the UUID of it
- vim /etc/fstab --------> Create the mount point inside the fstab

   UUID=c3ac5a96-80a9-44c3-b51e-9531e9ed9f08 /gluster ext4 defaults 0 0

- mount -a ------> Mount it
- df -hT ----> verify it is mounted 


14. create a new 150MB swap partition f/s.
(Note because partition sizes are seldom exactly what is specified when they are created,
any thing within the range of 130MB to 170MB is acceptable)

- free -m
-fdisk -l
- fdisk /dev/vdb (t=82)
- partprobe
- mkswap /dev/vdb2
- swapon /dev/vdb2
- vim /etc/fstab  (uuid swap swap defaults 0 0)
- swapon -a
- free -m
-
   
15. create a repositary for http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd
Chapter 7 -Enabling yum software repository


- vim /etc/yum.repos.d/myrepo.repo
	[short-name]
	name = Local Repo for RHCSA exam
	baseurl = http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd
	gpgcheck = 0
	enabled = 1
Test:

- yum clean all
- yum list all
- yum repolist


16. Install the appropriate kernel update from http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/errata
The following criteria must also be met:
–>The updated kernel is the default kerneal when the system rebooted. (do yum install kernel and NOT yum update, HOWEVER, kernel update is a install anyways, so it does not matter in the case of kernel)
–>The original kernel remains available and bootable on the system

# we can add the repo use: yum-config-manager --add-repo=”http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/errata”
# then modify the repo by edting the //etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo file 
  add gpgcheck=0
# we can disable the other repos using
- yum-config-manager –-disable <repo id>

- vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhcsa.repo

	[kernelrepo]
	name = Local Repo for Kernel
	baseurl = [url="http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/errata"]http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/errata[/url]
	gpgcheck = 0
	enabled = 1
	 
- yum repolist

Run this command before installing the kernel
- yum list kernel
- uname -rms
	Linux 3.10.0-123.el7.x86_64 x86_64
Install the kernel
- yum install kernel

After Kernel installation, reboot the system and run this command again
- yum list kernel
- uname -rms
Linux 3.10.0-123.1.2.el7.x86_64 x86_64

17. Bind with LDAP used provided by classroom.example.com for userr authentication.
Note the following:-
–> The LDAP search base DN is dc=example,dc=com
–> The LDAP certificate file is
http://classroom.example.com/pub/EXAMPLE-CA-CERT
–>ldapuserX should be able to log into your system, whereX is your ServerX ((hint:where X is your domain number),
but will not have a home directory, until you have completed the autofs requirement,below all LDAP users have password of “password”

Chapter 3 – using Identity Management service

-  yum install authconfig-gtk sssd krb5-workstation
- yum install auth* -y
- yum install sssd* -y
- authconfig-gtk
	selecdt LDAP
	DN: dc=example,dc=com
	server: ldap://classroom.example.com (just starting from clasroom. Is fine)
	choose TLS
	click on 'download CA certificate
	link: http://classroom.example.com/pub/EXAMPLE-CA-CERT (lower case is ok)
	authentication MethodL LADP password

if use Kerberos password
- Realm is EXAMPLE.COM (USE CAP LETTER)
- kdcS: classroom.example.com
- admin server: classroom.example.com

On Advance options- check create home directoryies on first login

	apply
- systemctl enable sssd.service
- systemctl start sssd.service

Verification:
- getent passewd ldapuser0
(should get some output)
 
18. configure autofs to automount the home directories of LDAP users,
Note the following:
–>classroom.example.com (172.25.254.254), NFS-exports /home/guests to your system, whereX is your server Number.
–>LDAP userX’s home directory is classroom.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX
–>LdapuserX’s home directory should be automounted locally beneath /home as /home/guests/ldapuserX
–>home directories must be writable by their users
–>while you are able to login as any of the users ldapuser1 through ldapuser20 the only home directory that is accessible from
your system is ldapuserX.
Example:- classroom.example.com would configure the automaster such that ldapuser100’s home directory /home/guests/ldapuserX gets mounted automatically upon login. The NFS share would be classroom.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuser100

- yum install autofs
- vim /etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs
	/home/guests /etc/auto.home
- vim /etc/auto.home
	ldapuser9 -rw,sync classroom.example.com:/home/guests/&
- systemctl enable autofs.service
- systemctl start autofs.service

Verification:
- ssh ldapuser9@localhost
- df -h

19. Configure your system so that it is an NTP client of classroom.example.com

- yum install chrony

	# comment out allother servers
	server classroom.example.com iburst

- systemctl restart chronyd
- systemctl enable chronyd

Verification:
- chronyc sources -V --> to check the reach level

20. create a new physical volume, create a new volume group in the name of datacontainer, vg extent is 16.00MB
create a new logical volume in the name of datacopy with the size of 50 extents and file system must vfat then
mount it under /datasource

- fdisk /dev/vdb ----- > Create the Partition of 802M[ (16*50) + 2 ] and set it's type 8e (which is LVM type)
- partx /dev/vdb --- If you didn't get the partition, just reboot the system, don't get panic
- pvcreate /dev/vdb5
- vgcreate -s 16M datacontainer /dev/vdb5
- vgdisplay -----> Check the vg extent size, its should be this (PE Size 16.00 MiB)
- lvcreate -l 50 -n datacopy datacontainer
- lvdisplay ------------> Check the size of extents and it should be(Current LE 50)
- mkfs.vfat /dev/datacontainer/datacopy ------> Make a filesystem on it

- mkdir -p /gluster -----> Create Directory to mount on it
- blkid /dev/datacontainer/datacopy -----> get the UUID of /dev/datacontainer/datacopy
- vim /etc/fstab --------> Create the mount point inside the fstab
	UUID=C553-2BF5 /datasource vfat defaults 0 0

- mount -a

Verification:
- df -hT ----> verify it is mounted

21. Resize the logical volume, logical-data and it filesystem to 400MB.
Make sure that the filesystem contents remain intact.
(Note: partitions are seldom exactly  the size requested,so any thing within the range of 370MB to 430MB is acceptable)

df -Th -------> get the mount point of it
 
- umount /datasource
- e2fsck -f /dev/datacontainer/datacopy
- lvreduce -L 400M /dev/datacontainer/datacopy
- mount -a
Verify:
- lvdisplay

22. The user andrew must configure a cron job that runs daily at 14:23 local time and executes – /bin/echo hiya

yum install cronie

systemctl enable crond
systemctl start crond
crontab -eu andrew

23 14 * * * /bin/echo hiya

Verification:
crontab -lu andrew

23. activate and start firewalld
- systemctl start firewalld
- systemctl enable firewalld
- systemctl status firewalld

24. set the primary command prompt for user root to display the hostname, username, and current working diretory informaton in that order

-vim /etc/bashc (copy the line ["$PS1" = )
- cd root and vim .bashrc (and paste the line in this file)
  and change it to PS1="[\h@\u \w]\\$ "

25. Create users sam, tom, steve, bob, and anna with home directiories in /home. 
set their passwords to user123 and 
make accounts for sam and tom expire on June 30, 2019 
User steve and bob should have their secondary groups set to group tech (create this group if does not exist)

- useradd sam ...
- passwd sam
- chage -E 2019-06-30 sam
- chage -l sam (to verify)
- tail /etc/group (to check if tech group exist)
- groupadd tech
- usermod -aG tech steve
- id steve (to verify)

26. Create a directory called dir1 as user anna in her home directory and 
set default ACLs on it for user sam for read and write access


- su anna
- mkdir dir1
- setfacl -m u:sam:rx /home/anna
- setfacl -m u:sam:rwx /home/anna/dir1
- su sam and touch a file

27. set up a local repo for the remote FTP yum repository in the /pub/ directory on S1
( the IP address for the S1 server is 192.168.0.120)


 28. Change the current hostname to cl.home.local
Chapter 10 – Configuring hostname and name resolution

- hostnamectl set-hostname cl.home.local
- hostnamectl status
- cat //etc/hostname

- cat //etc/resolv.conf (to see what dns settings are)

- getent hosts hostname  - to test host name resolution

29. set the default target to boot into graphical.atrget
- systemctl get-default (to check)
- systemctl set-default graphical.target


30. Install the ftp package and allow it to get document stored on CIFS mounted directories

- yum install -y vsftpd
- yum install -y setroubleshoot
- semanage boolean -l |grep ftp |grep cifs

32. Assign the same SELinux contexts that are used by the user's home directories to the /dir1 directory

- mkdir /dir1
- semange fcontext -a -t home_root_t /dir1
- restorecon -v /dir1/

to test:
- touch /dir1/test
- ls -Z /dir1/test

33. create suer ahmed with uid 1100, ahmed account expire 9 months from the date you create the account.

34. Create a directory name /admins. allow ahmed and rabah to share documents in the /admins directory 
using a group named admins. Both users can read write, users that are not member of the admins group cannot access the directory

- mkdir /admins
- groupadd admins
- usermod -aG admins ahmed
- usermod -aG admins rabah
- chgrp admins /admins
- chmod 2770 /admins

35. Create a cron job as root user that delete empty files and directory from /tmp at 00:30 am daily

- crontab -e
	30 00 * * * //bin/find /tmp -empty -delete 
- crontab -l

36. Allow Ahmed to get full access to rabah home directory
