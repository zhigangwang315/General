Notes:
to use GUI
systemctl set-default graphical.target

on VM:
ssh -Y root@vm
export DISPLAY=”DISPLAY="127.0.0.1:10.0"
Then try firewall-config should start the GUI

Also, I found one more bit of super useful notes, as well.  Try your best to memorize this, (practice practice practice) because it likely results in a decent portion of the points you'll receive on the test and it's super easy to get these out of the way.
The following notes are all of the packages you will need to install on the server and the client sides, all of the services needed to start and enable, and the firewall settings needed.  This was all gathered from going through each of the practices above and just writing down what was needed to run them successfully.  For the packages to install and services to start/enable, you can definitely install multiple packages in a row like this, there is no need to run "yum install <package>" for each one.  The formatting below should be accurate.

Server - 
yum groupinstall   (3)
	web-server

	iscsid (Isci initiator)
	nfs-secure 
(also run 'systemctl enable' for all of these)

Firewall settings - use the GUI (way easier than memorizing the CLI commands) firewall-config and enable the following services and ports for Permanent...don't forget to restart the firewalld service after:
- Applications > Sundry > Firewall (or firewall-config)
- choose permananet configration
- after change settings, reload filewalld : options→ Reload Firewalld

Server
  - Services: dns ssh http https nfs rpc-bind mountd samba mysql smtp   (10)
  - Ports: 3260/tcp
                 8909/tcp
Client
  - no configuration needed

From the lab:
Important: Also add a checkmark in front of the vnc-server service. Failing to
do so will lock out your graphical interface when you activate the firewall. If you do
accidentally lock yourself out, recover by using ssh -X serverX firewall-config
from your desktopX machine.
Just in case you need it
change the root passwd to root1234
-  Press e
- rd.break
- mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
- chroot /sysroot
- passwd root
- touch /.autorelabel
- exit twice

Configure your system to use a default repository:-
A yum repository has been provided at
http://server1.net13.example.com//rhel

Ans:-
#vim /etc/yum.repos.d/server.repo
[server]
name = Local Repo for RHCE exam
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
